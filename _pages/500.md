<p class="type-l type-serif type-italic read-xl">Something is breaking while executing. In most cases this error is connected to code errors, not to hardware problems.</p>

## Tips for the developer

* Check the [PHP error logs](https://help.fortrabbit.com/logging).
* Check for errors in the `.htaccess` file.
* A script stops with an error. Are your config files up to date? Turn on debugging to trace the error.
* Check for overload: More requests than the App can handle.
* Check our [500 troubleshooting](https://help.fortrabbit.com/app#toc-500-internal-server-error)
* Maybe it's something else. Please check the [fortrabbit status](http://status.fortrabbit.com).

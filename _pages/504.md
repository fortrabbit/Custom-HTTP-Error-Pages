<p class="type-l type-serif type-italic read-xl">This is a time-out. Something is blocking or taking too long to process so that the server times out. In most cases this error is connected to code errors, not to hardware problems.</p>

### Tips for the developer

* Likely this a configuration issue with your code. See our [troubleshooting guide](https://help.fortrabbit.com/504-errors)
* Maybe it's something with the hosting. Please check the [fortrabbit status](http://status.fortrabbit.com) if there is an ongoing incident.

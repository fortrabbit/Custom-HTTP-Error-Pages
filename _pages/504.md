<p class="type-l type-serif type-italic read-xl">This is a time-out. Something is blocking or taking too long to process so that the server times out. In most cases this error is connected to code errors, not to hardware problems.</p>

### Tips for the developer

* Ask yourself, what might be wrong with the request process here?
* It’s not likely that you can find something in the PHP error logs, as it just runs out of time.
* Are you doing heavy image transformations? Maybe cache them.
* Are you making calls to external APIs? Maybe something is down there?
* Is this page generating an expensive database query?
* Check for some sort of loop in your code.
* Use a profiler like Blackfire or NewRelic to find the bottleneck.
* Decrease/increase `max_timeout` setting for debugging.

Maybe it's some server problem after all, check [fortrabbit status](https://status.fortrabbit.com).

**Things will go wrong.** We at [fortrabbit](https://www.fortrabbit.com) like meaningful error messages. Here are our custom error pages for our PHP hosting platform. The syntax is hopefully valid HTML5. Feel free to rip, mix &amp; burn. The pages have been built using Metalsmith.io static generator, have a look at the [source](https://github.com/fortrabbit/Custom-HTTP-Error-Pages/tree/master).

                <p class="type-l type-serif type-italic read-xl">This is a time-out. Something is blocking or taking too long to process so that the server times out. In most cases this error is connected to code errors, not to hardware problems.</p>

<h3 id="tips-for-the-developer">Tips for the developer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is this page generating an expensive database query?</li>
<li>Are you doing heavy image transformations? Maybe cache them.</li>
<li>Are you making calls to external APIs? Maybe something is down there?</li>
<li>It’s not likely that you can find something in the PHP error logs, as it just runs out of time.</li>
<li>Ask yourself, what might be wrong with the request process here? Maybe a loop?</li>
<li>Use a profiler like Blackfire or NewRelic to find the bottleneck.</li>
<li>Decrease/increase <code>max_timeout</code> setting for debugging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe it&#39;s some server problem after all, check <a href="https://status.fortrabbit.com">fortrabbit status</a>.</p>
